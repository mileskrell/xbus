# [XBus](https://xbus.mileskrell.com)

XBus combines all your favorite Rutgers places from https://maps.rutgers.edu with all your favorite Rutgers buses
from https://rutgers.transloc.com.

Why did I make this? I like being able to see where the buses are, but I also think it's cool to be able to walk past a
building and be like, "huh, I wonder what that place is" and pull this out and go "oh, it's the Busch Campus Chiller
Plant, sick." So I put both things in one app.

For the best experience, I recommend viewing XBus on your phone.

Things on the map you can tap:

- tap a building or parking lot to see info about it (address, photo, website, etc.)
- tap a stop to see estimated arrival times
- tap a bus to see what stops it's arriving at next
- tap an empty spot on the map to deselect anything you've tapped

Other features:

- it shows line segments for bus routes! But only routes that currently have buses running, so it's not too cluttered
- it shows [Rutgers bus service announcements](https://rutgers.transloc.com/announcements)
- there's a button that lets you pick which routes will be shown in the rest of the app. This setting will be remembered
  for the next time you open XBus. E.g. if you uncheck the box for Route A, then:
  - you won't see the line segments for Route A on the map
  - you won't see any Route A buses on the map
  - when you tap a stop, you won't see any upcoming Route A arrivals
- there's a search box that lets you search for bus stops/buildings/parking lots
- there are buttons to let you jump to New Brunswick/Newark/Camden. The next time you open XBus, it'll start off at
  whichever campus you last tapped the button for.
- you can add it to your phone's home screen, so it can appear in its own window when it opens. If your browser supports
  this, then when you view the site in your browser, you should be able to find an "install" or "add to home screen"
  option somewhere
