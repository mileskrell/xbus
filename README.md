# [XBus](https://xbus.mileskrell.com)

XBus combines all your favorite Rutgers buildings and parking lots and walkways from https://maps.rutgers.edu with all your favorite Rutgers buses from https://rutgers.transloc.com.

Things you can tap:
- tap a building or parking lot to see info about it (address, photo, website, etc.)
- tap a stop to see estimated arrival times
- tap a bus to see what stops it's arriving at next
- tap an empty spot on the map to deselect anything you've tapped

Other features:
- it shows bus routes! But just the routes that have buses running, so it's not too cluttered
- there's a search box that lets you search for bus stops/buildings/parking lots
- there are buttons to let you jump to New Brunswick/Newark/Camden. The next time you open the map, it'll start off at whichever campus you last tapped the button for.
- you can add it to your phone's home screen, so it can appear in its own window when it opens. If your browser supports this, then when you view the site in your browser, you should be able to find an "install" or "add to home screen" option somewhere
